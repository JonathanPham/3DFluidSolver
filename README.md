# 3DFluidSolver
3D Fluid Solver based on Stable Fluids paper.

This is an implementation of a 3D Fluid Solver based on Jos Stams' "Stable Fluids" paper.
It uses a colocated grid instead of a staggered grid since this is straightforward to implement.

Main program outputs the simulation frames in PBRT format.
